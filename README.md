SIMUPRO

SIMUPRO is a project developed as part of my Thesis work. It is a simulation tool that allows users to explore and analyze the topology of graph-based games.

Functionalities:

- Graph topology editing tool to represent the game environment structure.
- Search algorithms to simulate player progress in the games, providing dynamic analysis.
- Configurable elements to allow environment and characteristics adaptation.
- Data analysis using heatmaps, providing clear visualization of challenging areas and player paths.

Technologies Used:

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the code.
- Other dependencies and tools used.
